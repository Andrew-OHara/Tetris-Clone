# Tetris-Clone
A clone of the classic puzzle game I created at a time when I had nothing but an old lap top with Linux and Codeblocks. Created for fun and to practice writing C.

This project was coded using an old version of the Allegro game engine. www.liballeg.org

Please note: this project would need to be compiled and linked with the Allegro library in order to run. It is an old personal project that was never intended to be shared and is only meant to demonstrate my code style.
