# Tetris-Clone
A clone of the classic puzzle game I created at a time when I had nothing but an old lap top with Linux and Codeblocks. Created for fun and to practice writing C.

This project was coded using an old version of the Allegro game engine. www.liballeg.org

Please note: This was never intended to be shared - it was a personal project for the sake of learning. I have included it here simply to demonstrate that I am capable of solving problems using C.
